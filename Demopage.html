<h1>Moto Mods</h1>
<h4><u>What is a Mod?</u></h4>
<p>A slew of new <b>Moto Mods</b> are headed our way, which include a <b><i>power pack</b></i>, a <b><i>wireless charging adaptor</b></i>, and a <b><i>turbo charging adaptor</b></i>. But the most interesting of the bunch is the <b><u>Amazon Alexa Moto Mod</u></b>, which will add the virtual assistant into any Moto Z device.

At its Mobile World Congress keynote, Amazon’s Director of Alexa Voice Service Jon Kirk announced that it would partner with <b>Motorola</b> to create a speaker Moto Mod that essentially turns your phone into a portable Amazon Echo. In a concept video, the Mod is stuck to the back of a Moto Z, and users can place their phone screen side down to use it as a speaker. It’ll even have the blue ombre glow around the edges to let you know when you’ve activated Alexa. The Alexa Moto Mod is expected to launch later this year.<br></p>
